# Food Sharing Platform

The Food Sharing Platform is a web application that aims to connect individuals and businesses with surplus food to those in need. The platform provides a convenient way for users to donate excess food items or request meals, facilitating the coordination, pickup, and delivery of the food. It also incorporates features like nutritional information and allergy alerts to ensure the safety and suitability of the donated food.

## Features

- **Donation:** Users can easily create listings for surplus food items they wish to donate. They can provide details such as the type of food, quantity, expiration date, and pickup location.
- **Request:** Users in need of meals can create requests specifying their dietary preferences, allergies, and location. 
- **Coordination:** The platform provides a messaging system to facilitate communication between donors and recipients. Users can arrange pickup details, clarify any questions, and coordinate the delivery of food.
- **Nutritional Information:** Donors can provide nutritional information for their food items, enabling recipients to make informed decisions based on their dietary requirements.
- **Allergy Alerts:** Users can specify their allergies or dietary restrictions, and the platform will notify them if a donation or request contains any potential allergens.
- **User Profiles:** Users can create and manage their profiles, providing information such as their location, dietary preferences, and allergies. This helps personalize the donation and request matching process.
